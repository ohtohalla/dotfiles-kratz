# MacOS Initial Setup

To use first create SSH keys by [this instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

Afterwards curl the ```.install.sh```, make it executable and run it.

After the install, open Neovim and run ```PlugInstall``` and ```PlugUpdate```.

At this point you need to enable Rectangle or Amethyst manually, but that can hopefully be done automatically in the future.
